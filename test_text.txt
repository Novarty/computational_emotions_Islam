I have bad news. Last night there was an accident with my car, which was parked. Do not worry, the damage is minor. Yesterday at 10 pm I just walked over to my house, it was dark, and suddenly I heard a blow "boom!". On my keychain the alarm went off. I thought "what a stupid moron is there in my parking lot!". I was frightened, and when I came closer to the car I saw my neighbor. That’s mad man from the 23rd house! He was scared no less than I did. It turned out that because of the darkness he wrongly estimated the distance to my car. He swore that he was sorry, apologized, promising to recover all the damage… But I'm upset, I do not believe him, he is not the most reliable person, I think we will have problems with him.
