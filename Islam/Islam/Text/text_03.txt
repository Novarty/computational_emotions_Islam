Chain saw Sadko GCS 510E (light start). I bought an online store "Green Line". As for the service, I really liked (like) it! They quickly contacted me, and that the most pleasant thing the same day after confirming the purchase, they sent me my saw. Also pleasantly pleased that they sent cash on delivery, on a new mail examined the saw for defects and for a complete set. As for the saw itself - I liked (like) it. This is the first saw I have so I can not give detailed data. I got sick easily, I did not need to poke a fuel pumping button, I jerked it three times and earned it! On idle keeps excellent, until the gasoline is over. awesome. useful, cute and impossible. As for the cutting of the tree, it seemed to me that it was difficult (the chain was stretched correctly), the feeling that the tree was not being pulled but pulled by pieces, but the shavings were the same. In general, the purchase is happy, will stick and will work fine!
